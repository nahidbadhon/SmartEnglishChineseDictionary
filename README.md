# SmartEnglishChineseDictionary
the code is about a simple design where English and Chinese words are loaded from a file, stored in lists and a dictionary, and then searched and displayed based on user input. The key algorithms used are regular expression splitting for data loading, string matching for word search, and dictionary mapping for retrieving Chinese counterparts.
